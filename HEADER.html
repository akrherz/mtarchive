<ul>
    <li><strong>17 Nov 2025:</strong> The bufkit folders are being transitioned
    to use a different mechanism to generate directory index files.  This will
    take a number of weeks to complete, sadly.  In the interim, direct file
    calls will contine to work.</li>
    <li><strong>17 Nov 2025:</strong> The College of DuPage satellite folders
    are being reorganized due to a discontinuation of a cloud storage service.

    are billions of files involved.</li>
